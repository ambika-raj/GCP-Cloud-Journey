# ‚òÅÔ∏è Ambika's Cloud Projects Journey

Welcome to my cloud computing journey!  
This repository contains all the mini tasks and hands-on projects I've completed while preparing for a career in Cloud Security.

## Why This Repo?
- To track my learning progress in cloud technologies
- To showcase real mini-projects and practical implementations
- To build an internship/job-ready portfolio with cloud use-cases
- To improve problem-solving and real-world deployment skills

## Projects / Mini Tasks:

- **01-gcp-vm-web server**: Set up a VM on GCP and hosted a webpage using Apache
- **02-visitor-logging-system**: Hosted a Tic-Tac-Toe web app on GCP VM using NGINX and implemented a visitor logging system with Cloud Pub/Sub and Cloud Functions.
- **03-intelligent-traffic-monitoring-&-prediction-system**: A working intelligent traffic monitoring & prediction system that simulates real-world scenarios of traffic congestion, monitors activity through logs, predicts congestion using machine learning, and visualizes insights via a BigQuery dashboard.
- (more coming soon)

Each folder contains:
- Overview
- Technologies used
- What I did  
- What I learned  
- Screenshots and files (if any)
